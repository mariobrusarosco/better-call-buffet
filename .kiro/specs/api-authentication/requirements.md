# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive authentication and authorization system for the Better Call Buffet API. The system will provide secure user registration, login, token-based authentication, role-based access control, and session management suitable for modern web applications. The authentication system will protect all financial data endpoints and ensure only authorized users can access their respective resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with my email and password, so that I can access the financial management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data with email and password THEN the system SHALL validate the email format and password strength
2. WHEN a user registers with a valid email and strong password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and return a success response
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with an already existing email THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the email is already in use
4. WHEN a user submits a password THEN the system SHALL require at least 8 characters with mixed case, numbers, and special characters
5. WHEN a user account is created THEN the system SHALL hash and salt the password before storing it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials, so that I can access my financial data securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return a JWT access token
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error without revealing whether email or password was incorrect
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL return both access and refresh tokens
4. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL log the authentication attempt for security monitoring
5. WHEN a user fails login attempts 5 times within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to remain active without frequent re-authentication, so that I can use the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives an access token THEN the token SHALL be valid for 15 minutes
2. WHEN a user receives a refresh token THEN the token SHALL be valid for 7 days
3. WHEN an access token expires THEN the user SHALL be able to use their refresh token to obtain a new access token
4. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL issue a new access token and optionally rotate the refresh token
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both access and refresh tokens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access only my own financial data, so that my information remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes an API request THEN the system SHALL verify the JWT token is valid and not expired
2. WHEN a user accesses account data THEN the system SHALL ensure they can only view accounts they own
3. WHEN a user accesses transaction data THEN the system SHALL filter results to only include their transactions
4. WHEN a user attempts to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
5. WHEN an unauthenticated request is made to protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to different features and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL assign them a default "user" role
2. WHEN an admin creates a user THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of roles including "user", "admin", and "readonly"
3. WHEN a user with "admin" role accesses the system THEN they SHALL have access to all user management endpoints
4. WHEN a user with "readonly" role accesses the system THEN they SHALL only have read access to their own data
5. WHEN role-based access is checked THEN the system SHALL verify the user's role allows the requested operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL generate a secure reset token valid for 1 hour
2. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL send a reset link to the user's registered email
3. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL allow them to set a new password
4. WHEN a password reset token is used THEN the system SHALL invalidate the token to prevent reuse
5. WHEN a password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions for that user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to see my active sessions and be able to revoke them, so that I can manage my account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in from a new device/location THEN the system SHALL create a new session record
2. WHEN a user requests their active sessions THEN the system SHALL return a list with device info, location, and last activity
3. WHEN a user revokes a session THEN the system SHALL invalidate the associated refresh token
4. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke all other active sessions
5. WHEN a session is inactive for 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically expire the session

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want clear authentication errors and status codes, so that I can handle authentication flows properly in client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 403, 422)
2. WHEN a token is expired THEN the system SHALL return a 401 status with a clear error message indicating token expiration
3. WHEN a token is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a 401 status with an error message about invalid token format
4. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL return a 429 status with retry-after headers
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed field-level error messages in a consistent format
