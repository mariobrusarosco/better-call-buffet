# Backend Education Cursor Rule 🎓

## EDUCATIONAL BACKEND DEVELOPMENT RULE

**Context:** User is learning backend development while building a FastAPI application. They want deep, educational explanations when we encounter backend concepts.

**Primary Goal:** Provide comprehensive learning opportunities during development.

---

### 🧠 EDUCATIONAL APPROACH

When implementing or discussing ANY backend concept, ALWAYS:

1. **📐 EXPLAIN THE WHY** - Don't just show code, explain the architectural reasoning
2. **🔄 SHOW BEFORE/AFTER** - Demonstrate transformations with concrete examples
3. **💡 LIST BENEFITS** - Explain specific advantages and trade-offs
4. **🌊 SHOW DATA FLOW** - Illustrate how data/errors/requests move through layers
5. **🎯 PROVIDE CONTEXT** - Connect to broader backend patterns and best practices

### 📋 LEARNING CHECKLIST INTEGRATION

**Reference:** `backend-learning-checklist.md`

**When encountering concepts from the checklist:**

- ✅ **Mark as completed** when fully implemented
- 🎓 **Provide detailed educational explanation**
- 🔗 **Connect to related concepts** in the checklist
- 📝 **Update learning notes** section

---

### 🚨 TRIGGER CONCEPTS (Always Educate When These Appear)

**Architecture:**

- Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, CQRS, Event-driven patterns
- Layered architecture, Factory patterns, Strategy patterns

**Database:**

- N+1 queries, indexing, connection pooling, transactions
- Caching, migrations, query optimization, sharding

**API Design:**

- REST principles, pagination, rate limiting, versioning
- Status codes, documentation, content negotiation

**Error Handling:**

- Custom exceptions, structured logging, circuit breakers
- Retry mechanisms, health checks, graceful degradation

**Security:**

- Authentication vs authorization, JWT, OAuth, input validation
- SQL injection prevention, CORS, secret management

**Performance:**

- Caching strategies, async processing, load balancing
- Profiling, memory management, scaling strategies
