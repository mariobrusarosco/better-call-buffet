üéì EDUCATIONAL MODE ACTIVATED: This request involves '$trigger' - a key backend concept.

Please provide:
1. üìê EXPLAIN THE WHY - Architectural reasoning behind the implementation
2. üîÑ SHOW BEFORE/AFTER - Demonstrate the transformation with concrete examples
3. üí° LIST BENEFITS - Explain specific advantages and trade-offs
4. üåä SHOW DATA FLOW - Illustrate how data/errors/requests move through layers
5. üéØ PROVIDE CONTEXT - Connect to broader backend patterns and best practices
