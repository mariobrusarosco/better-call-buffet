## Next Steps

To finish Phase 3, you should:

1. **Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment**
   - Use AWS Console following the deployment guide
   - Configure environment variables
   - Use security group IDs we've already set up

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check deployment health
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify database connection

3. **Finalize Monitoring**
   - Run CloudWatch dashboard script after environment is created
   - Test alarms

## Elastic Beanstalk Environment Creation Steps

Follow these steps in the AWS Console:

1. **Go to Elastic Beanstalk Console**
   - Region: us-east-1

2. **Create Application** (if not already created)
   - Use name: `better-call-buffet`

3. **Create Environment**
   - Environment tier: Web server environment
   - Platform: Python 3.8 or 3.10
   - Application code: Upload your ZIP file (latest `better-call-buffet-*.zip`)
   - Environment name: `better-call-buffet-prod`

4. **Configure Service Access**
   - EC2 key pair: (optional) Select or create
   - EC2 instance profile: `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`

5. **Set Up Networking**
   - VPC: `BCB-Production-VPC`
   - Subnets: `bcb-public-1a`, `bcb-public-1b`
   - Security group: `BCB-App-SG` (sg-0a216606cd71ef3b6)

6. **Configure Instances**
   - Instance type: t2.micro
   - Root volume: 10GB, General Purpose (gp2)

7. **Set Up Capacity**
   - Environment type: Load balanced
   - Instances: Min 1, Max 2
   - Instance type: t2.micro
   - Scaling trigger: CPU utilization (High 70%, Low 30%)

8. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:************h@************.amazonaws.com:5432/better_call_buffet
   API_V1_PREFIX=/api/v1
   PROJECT_NAME=Better Call Buffet
   SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=["https://app.bettercallbuffet.com"]
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
   ```

9. **Configure Monitoring**
   - System: Basic or Enhanced
   - Health reporting: Enhanced
   - Health check URL: `/health`

10. **Review and Create**
    - Click "Create Environment"

## After Environment Creation

1. **Run CloudWatch Dashboard Script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create_cloudwatch_dashboard.sh
   ```

2. **Test the Application**
   - Access the application URL provided by Elastic Beanstalk
   - Test the `/health` endpoint
   - Test the API using Swagger UI at `/docs`

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Fill in actual environment URL
   - Document any specific configuration details

## Conclusion

With the completion of Phase 3, the Better Call Buffet application will be fully deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with proper monitoring, scaling, and security in place. The FastAPI application will be connected to the PostgreSQL RDS instance created in Phase 2, and all infrastructure will be properly documented with decision records, guides, and runbooks.

We've also enhanced the development process with improved CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive documentation on development practices, and optimized testing structure. This ensures not only a solid production environment but also a smooth development experience for the team.
