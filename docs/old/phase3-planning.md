## Cost Estimation (Updated)
| Service | Configuration | Est. Monthly Cost |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Elastic Beanstalk | 1-2 t2.micro instances | $15-30 |
| Application Load Balancer | 1 ALB | $16-20 |
| Route 53 | Domain hosting | $0.50 |
| ACM | SSL certificate | Free |
| CloudWatch | Basic monitoring | $2-5 |
| **Total Estimated Cost** | | **$34-55.50/month** |

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Day 1-2**: Create Elastic Beanstalk application and environment
2. **Day 3-4**: Configure DNS, SSL, and security settings
3. **Day 5-6**: Set up monitoring and alerts
4. **Day 7**: Testing and documentation

## Success Criteria
- Application is deployed and accessible via custom domain
- API endpoints function correctly
- Database connection is secure and functional
- Auto-scaling works as expected
- Monitoring and alerts are properly configured
- Deployment process is fully documented and repeatable
- CI/CD pipeline is functioning properly

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Deployment failures | High | Medium | Thorough testing before production deployment |
| Database connection issues | High | Low | Verify security group configurations |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Proper sizing and monitoring |
| Cost overruns | Medium | Low | Regular cost monitoring and optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits and updates |

## Conclusion
Phase 3 focuses on deploying the FastAPI application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. With the setup complete and the packaging script working, we are ready to proceed with creating the Elastic Beanstalk application and environment in the AWS Console. The deployment guide provides detailed instructions for this process, and the GitHub Actions workflow enables automated deployments for future updates.

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on deploying the Better Call Buffet FastAPI application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This phase will establish the application infrastructure, configure auto-scaling, set up CI/CD, and configure monitoring for the application tier.

## Goals

1. Set up Elastic Beanstalk environments
2. Deploy the FastAPI application
3. Configure auto-scaling and load balancing
4. Establish application monitoring
5. Implement CI/CD pipeline
6. Document application deployment process

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Completed VPC setup from Phase 1
- ✅ Functional RDS database from Phase 2
- ✅ Working FastAPI application codebase

## Cost Analysis

```
Estimated Monthly Costs:
├── Elastic Beanstalk: Free (service itself)
├── EC2 instances: ~$8.50/month per instance
│   └── Free tier eligible for 12 months (t2.micro)
├── Load Balancer: ~$16.50/month
│   └── Not free tier eligible
├── S3 Storage: ~$0.25/month (application versions)
└── CloudWatch: Free tier/minimal

Total: ~$25-30/month
       ~$0-10/month during free tier
```

## Decision Points

1. **Environment Type**
   - Single Instance (lower cost) vs. Load Balanced (higher availability)
   - Initially: Load Balanced with min 1, max 2 instances

2. **Deployment Policy**
   - All at once (faster, more risk) vs. Rolling (slower, less risk)
   - Initially: All at once for development speed

3. **Platform Branch**
   - Python 3.8 vs. Docker platform
   - Initially: Python 3.8 (simpler setup)
