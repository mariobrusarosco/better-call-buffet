# ADR-006: Enterprise CI/CD Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a robust, enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline that follows industry best practices for reliability, security, and maintainability. Our previous pipeline had issues with database dependencies, testing strategies, and deployment patterns that don't align with enterprise standards.

## Decision

### 1. **Separation of Concerns Architecture**

#### Pipeline Stages:

```
Static Analysis → Unit Tests → Integration Tests → Security Scanning → Build → Push → Deploy
```

**Why this matters:**

- **Fast Feedback**: Developers get immediate feedback on code quality issues
- **Cost Efficiency**: Catch issues early when they're cheaper to fix
- **Parallel Execution**: Most stages can run in parallel for faster builds

#### Stage Breakdown:

**🔍 Static Analysis** (30 seconds)

- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Security scanning (Safety, pip-audit)
- Dependency vulnerability checks

**🧪 Unit Tests** (1-2 minutes)

- No external dependencies
- SQLite for database tests
- Fast, reliable, isolated

**🐳 Integration Tests** (3-5 minutes)

- Real PostgreSQL database
- Full container testing
- Database migration validation

**🔒 Security Scanning** (2-3 minutes)

- Container vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
- Supply chain security
- Compliance checks

### 2. **Database Migration Strategy**

#### Problem with Previous Approach:

```dockerfile
# ❌ BAD: Tightly coupled
CMD ["sh", "-c", "poetry run alembic upgrade head && poetry run uvicorn app.main:app"]
```

**Issues:**

- Migration failure prevents application rollback
- Downtime during migrations
- No migration rollback capability
- Coupling application lifecycle with database schema

#### Enterprise Solution:

```dockerfile
# ✅ GOOD: Separate containers
# Dockerfile.migrate - Migration-only container
# Dockerfile - Application-only container
```

**Benefits:**

- Independent deployment lifecycles
- Zero-downtime deployments possible
- Better rollback strategies
- Clearer separation of concerns

### 3. **Testing Strategy Pyramid**

```
              🔺 E2E Tests (Slow)
            🔶 Integration Tests (Medium)
        🔷 Unit Tests (Fast)
    🔹 Static Analysis (Fastest)
```

**Unit Tests (70%)**:

- Fast execution (< 2 minutes)
- No external dependencies
- SQLite for database tests
- Mock external services

**Integration Tests (20%)**:

- Real PostgreSQL database
- Container testing
- API endpoint validation
- Database migration testing

**E2E Tests (10%)**:

- Full environment testing
- Production-like scenarios
- Performance validation

### 4. **Container Security & Optimization**

#### Multi-layered Security:

```yaml
# Security scanning with Trivy
- name: 🔍 Security Scan Docker Image
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
```

#### Container Optimization:

- **Multi-stage builds** for smaller images
- **Minimal base images** (python:3.11-slim)
- **Layer caching** for faster builds
- **Health checks** built into containers

### 5. **Environment Management**

#### Environment Hierarchy:

```
Development → Staging → Production
    ↓         ↓         ↓
  SQLite   PostgreSQL PostgreSQL
  No SSL     SSL      SSL+Monitoring
```

#### Configuration Strategy:

- **Environment Variables** for configuration
- **AWS Secrets Manager** for sensitive data
- **Different deployment strategies** per environment

### 6. **Deployment Patterns**

#### Current: Basic Deployment

```yaml
# Simple push to App Runner
aws apprunner update-service
```

#### Enterprise: Staged Deployment

```yaml
# 1. Run migrations separately
aws ecs run-task --task-definition migrate-db

# 2. Deploy application
aws apprunner update-service

# 3. Health check validation
# 4. Rollback if needed
```

## Implementation Benefits

### 🚀 **Speed & Efficiency**

- **Parallel execution**: Multiple jobs run simultaneously
- **Smart caching**: Docker layer caching, Poetry dependency caching
- **Fast feedback**: Static analysis completes in 30 seconds

### 🔒 **Security & Compliance**

- **Container scanning**: Vulnerability detection before deployment
- **Dependency auditing**: Supply chain security
- **Secrets management**: No hardcoded credentials

### 🛡️ **Reliability & Observability**

- **Health checks**: Validate deployments automatically
- **Monitoring integration**: Post-deployment validation
- **Rollback capability**: Safe deployment practices

### 📊 **Developer Experience**

- **Clear pipeline stages**: Easy to understand failures
- **Detailed logging**: Rich feedback on issues
- **Branch protection**: Different strategies per environment

## Enterprise Patterns Implemented

### 1. **GitOps Workflow**

```
Feature Branch → PR → Review → Merge → Deploy
```

### 2. **Immutable Infrastructure**

- Container images are immutable
- Tagged with commit SHA
- No in-place updates

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code**

- Pipeline defined in YAML
- Version controlled
- Reproducible across environments

### 4. **Observability First**

- Health checks at every stage
- Detailed logging and metrics
- Monitoring integration ready
