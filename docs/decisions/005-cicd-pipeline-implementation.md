# ADR-005: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Better Call Buffet is a FastAPI-based financial tracking application that requires a robust, automated deployment pipeline. The application handles sensitive financial data and needs to maintain high reliability and security standards.

### Current Challenges:

- Manual deployment processes prone to human error
- Inconsistent code quality across team members
- Security vulnerabilities not caught early in development
- Lack of automated validation before production deployment
- No standardized development workflow

### Requirements:

- Automated code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Containerized deployment to AWS App Runner
- Fast feedback loop for developers
- Production deployment safety measures
- Educational value for backend learning

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with the following architecture:

### Pipeline Stages:

1. **Lint & Security Checks**: Code quality and security validation
2. **Code Validation**: Application structure and import verification
3. **Docker Build & Test**: Container creation and smoke testing
4. **Production Deployment**: AWS App Runner deployment
5. **Cleanup**: Resource management and maintenance

### Technology Choices:

#### CI/CD Platform: GitHub Actions

- **Rationale**: Native integration with GitHub, extensive marketplace, free for public repos
- **Alternatives considered**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- **Decision factors**: Simplicity, cost, integration quality

#### Deployment Target: AWS App Runner

- **Rationale**: Serverless container service, automatic scaling, simplified deployment
- **Alternatives considered**: AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Decision factors**: Ease of use, cost-effectiveness, container support

#### Code Quality Tools:

- **Black**: Code formatting for consistency
- **isort**: Import organization
- **Flake8**: Linting and style checking
- **MyPy**: Type checking for better code safety
- **Safety**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **pip-audit**: Additional dependency security checks

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline Configuration

```yaml
# Trigger conditions
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# Environment variables
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"
  POETRY_VERSION: "1.8.3"
```

### Security Measures

1. **Secrets Management**: All sensitive data stored in GitHub Secrets
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
3. **Container Security**: Docker image scanning and validation
4. **Access Control**: Minimal AWS IAM permissions

### Deployment Strategy

- **Branch-based deployment**: Only `main` branch deploys to production
- **Health checks**: Automated verification of deployed application
- **Rollback capability**: Quick recovery from failed deployments

## Consequences

### Positive:

- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated formatting and linting ensure consistency
- **Enhanced Security**: Early detection of vulnerabilities
- **Faster Deployments**: Automated process reduces deployment time
- **Reduced Errors**: Elimination of manual deployment steps
- **Better Collaboration**: Standardized development workflow
- **Educational Value**: Developers learn DevOps best practices

### Negative:

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires configuration of AWS credentials and secrets
- **Build Time**: Additional time for quality checks and security scans
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand GitHub Actions workflow
- **Dependency on GitHub**: Vendor lock-in to GitHub ecosystem

### Neutral:

- **Cost**: GitHub Actions free tier should cover most usage
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates needed for dependencies and tools

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Success Metrics:

- Pipeline success rate > 95%
- Average deployment time < 10 minutes
- Security vulnerabilities caught in CI > 90%
- Developer satisfaction with workflow

### Monitoring:

- GitHub Actions dashboard for pipeline status
- AWS CloudWatch for application health
- Manual review of security scan results

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Pipeline Setup (Week 1)

- Create GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure AWS App Runner service
- Set up GitHub Secrets

### Phase 2: Team Training (Week 2)

- Document workflow procedures
- Train team on new development process
- Establish code review standards

### Phase 3: Optimization (Ongoing)

- Monitor pipeline performance
- Optimize build times
- Enhance security scanning

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Jenkins

- **Pros**: Highly customizable, extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: Requires infrastructure management, complex setup
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead

### Alternative 2: AWS CodePipeline

- **Pros**: Native AWS integration, managed service
- **Cons**: More complex setup, higher cost, less flexibility
- **Verdict**: Rejected in favor of GitHub Actions simplicity

### Alternative 3: GitLab CI

- **Pros**: Integrated with GitLab, powerful features
- **Cons**: Would require migration from GitHub
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to existing GitHub investment

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:

- **Multi-environment deployment**: Staging environment before production
- **Blue-green deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Advanced monitoring**: Application performance monitoring
- **Automated rollback**: Automatic rollback on health check failures
- **Slack notifications**: Team notifications for deployment status

### Technology Evolution:

- Monitor GitHub Actions feature updates
- Evaluate AWS App Runner alternatives as they mature
- Consider container orchestration platforms for scaling needs
