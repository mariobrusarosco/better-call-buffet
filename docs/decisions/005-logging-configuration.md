# Logging Configuration Improvement

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application needed better visibility into its operations, particularly for debugging database connection issues and tracking application behavior. The default logging configuration was minimal and didn't provide sufficient information for troubleshooting.

## Decision
We implemented a centralized logging configuration with the following features:

1. Created a dedicated module `app/core/logging_config.py` for logging configuration
2. Configured logging with:
   - Log level set to INFO by default
   - Structured log format including timestamp, level, module, and message
   - Console output directed to stdout
   - Special configuration for SQLAlchemy to log database operations
   - Formatter pattern: `[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s in %(module)s: %(message)s`

Example of the logging configuration:
```python
def setup_logging():
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(
        '[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s in %(module)s: %(message)s'
    )
    console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)
    logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine').setLevel(logging.INFO)
    return logger
```

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Better visibility into application operations
2. Structured logging format makes logs easier to read and parse
3. Database operations are now logged at INFO level, making it easier to debug SQL issues
4. Consistent logging format across the application
5. Centralized logging configuration makes it easier to modify logging behavior

### Negative
1. Slightly increased verbosity in logs
2. Minor memory overhead from additional logging

## Usage
The logging configuration is automatically set up when the application starts. To use logging in any module:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Example usage
logger.info("Operation completed successfully")
logger.error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)
```

## Future Considerations
1. Add log rotation to manage log file sizes
2. Add file-based logging for production environments
3. Consider adding structured logging (JSON format) for better log aggregation
4. Implement different log levels for different environments (development/staging/production)
